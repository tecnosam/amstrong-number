# Armstrong Numbers 
An Armstrong number is one in which the sum of each digit raised to the power of the total number of digits is equal to the number.

### Example
153: 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1+125+27 = 153


## What we did
Created a program to print all Armstrong Numbers of a particular digit using multiple programming languages. Feel free to add yours..
